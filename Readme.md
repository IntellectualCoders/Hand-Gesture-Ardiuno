#   Title. Hand Gestured Controlled VLC Player...
 
 #    Field of Invention of project. The Technology is based on Tensor Flow Technique...
	 
	Background: The concept behind the project is very simple. We will place two Ultrasonic (US) sensors on top of our monitor and will read the distance between the monitor and our hand using Arduino, based on this value of distance we will perform certain actions. To perform actions on our computer we use Python pyautogui library. The commands from Arduino are sent to the computer through serial port (USB). This data will be then read by python which is running on the computer and based on the read data an action will be performed 

#  Summary
Recently Gesture controlled Laptops or computers are getting very famous. This technique is called Leap motion which enables us to control certain functions on our computer/Laptop by simply waving our hand in front of it. It is very cool and fun to do it, but these laptops are really priced very high. So in this project let us try building our own Gesture control Laptop/Computer by combining the Power of Arduino and Python

Definitions of each components of the project
 
A. Arduino: Arduino is an open-source hardware and software company, project and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices. 
B.  UltraSonic sensor-:  Ultrasonic transducers or ultrasonic sensors are a type of acoustic sensor divided into three broad categories: transmitters, receivers and transceivers. Transmitters convert electrical signals into ultrasound, receivers convert ultrasound into electrical signals, and transceivers can both transmit and receive ultrasound 
C. LCD Screen: A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals

#	General Claiming Notes
Describe invention: We have placed two Ultrasonic (US) sensors on top of our monitor which will read the distance between the monitor and our hand using Arduino, based on this value of distance we would perform certain actions. To perform actions on our computer we would use Python pyautogui library. The commands from Arduino are sent to the computer through serial port (USB). This data will be then read by python which is running on the computer and based on the read data an action will be performed.We have resticted it to controlling th VLC player as of now. But we can extend it to controlling the windows. 
Programming Language:This project is written in C++ in the arduino software and the distance information from Arduino is collected by a Python Program and a special library called PyAutoGUI which will convert the data into keyboard click actions. 
Cost of the project : arduino uno â€“ Rs 1500
                                   ultrasonic sensors (Qty-2 ) - Rs  230 
                                  LCD screen -  Rs 235  

# Damages(disadvantages or limitation or restriction):
1.	Limitted to keyboard key shortcuts.
2.	Limitted to the sentivity of ultrasonic sensors.


#	Abstract
A system for arduino based hand gesture controlled media player is disclosed. The system  reads the distance between the monitor and our hand using Arduino, based on this value of distance it performs certain actions.
